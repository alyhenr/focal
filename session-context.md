# Focal - Session Context

## Last Session Summary (Professional UI Redesign Complete)

### ‚úÖ Completed Setup (Previous Sessions)
1. **Authentication System** - Magic links + Google OAuth working
2. **Database Schema** - All tables with RLS policies
3. **Core Focus Management** - Complete CRUD with optimistic updates
4. **Professional UI Redesign** - Forest Calm palette, borderless design

### üéØ Recent Improvements (This Session)

#### **1. Bug Fixes & UX Improvements**
- **ESC key** to exit focus mode
- **Pause/Resume** functionality with proper state management
- **Session completion** without starting (can complete anytime)
- **Session review modal** with beautiful stats and completion summary
- **Stop vs Delete** - Stop ends session, Delete removes it
- **Optimistic checkpoint creation** - No page reloads
- **Fixed selection bug** - Sessions with same title don't swap

#### **2. Professional UI Redesign - "Forest Calm"**
- **Color Palette**: Switched from blue to sage green (#62C12 145 oklch)
- **Borderless Design**: 90% borders removed, using shadows instead
- **Typography**: Tighter letter-spacing, better hierarchy
- **Cards**: White on gray-50 background, layered shadows
- **Header**: Frosted glass effect with backdrop blur
- **Micro-interactions**: 150ms transitions, hover elevations
- **Result**: Looks like Linear/Notion meets Headspace

#### **3. Component Updates**
- **FocusBlocksGrid**: Minimal cards with status dots
- **FocusCard**: Clean paper-like feel, thin progress bars
- **Quick Actions**: Icon containers with hover states
- **Buttons**: Solid green, no gradients
- **Focus Mode**: Cleaner exit button with keyboard hint

### üîß Technical Details

#### Key Components Created:
- `/components/common/loading-button.tsx` - Universal loading button
- `/components/common/sign-out-button.tsx` - Client-side sign out with loading
- `/components/common/inline-editor.tsx` - Inline editing component
- `/components/focus/focus-blocks-grid.tsx` - Notebook-style grid
- `/components/focus/focus-card.tsx` - Enhanced focus card (replaces old one)
- `/stores/focus-store.ts` - Zustand state management

#### Components Removed:
- `/components/focus/active-focus-card.tsx` - Replaced with focus-card.tsx

### üêõ Fixed Issues
- All ESLint errors resolved
- TypeScript strict types implemented
- Build passing cleanly
- Removed all `prompt()` and `alert()` calls

### üìù Important Implementation Notes

1. **No "-enhanced" Pattern** - We replace components, not create enhanced versions
2. **Loading States Everywhere** - Every async action must show loading feedback
3. **Inline Everything** - No popups, alerts, or prompts
4. **Notebook Metaphor** - Focus blocks as pages you can work on
5. **Focus Mode** - Visual transformation when entering work mode

### üé® Design Principles Established
- **Calm over energetic** - Subtle animations, soft colors

- **Progress over perfection** - Visual indicators everywhere
- **Notebook style** - Familiar metaphor for focus management

### üí° Key Concepts to Remember
- **Focus blocks** = Notebook pages
- **Focus mode** = Visual transformation for deep work
- **No alerts** = Everything inline or toast
- **Loading states** = Every button shows feedback
- **Optimistic updates** = Instant UI response

### üîÑ Current State

- Dashboard fully transformed with notebook-style interface
