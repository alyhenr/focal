## Main dashboard focus session usage

#### As a user:

* I want to be able to fetch all open tabs of browser, saving the URL of it, with a small preview of the page, and add a comment to it. So I can close my browser and have a context to pick up from when I open it later, maybe delete some pages that do not make sense, and organize my mental map. - When I comeback later I want to be able to click a button and re-open all these pages I previously saved from my lastest session in my workspace.
