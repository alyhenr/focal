# Focal - Project Brief

## Executive Summary
Focal is a mindful productivity web application that helps knowledge workers overcome daily overwhelm by limiting them to a single, meaningful focus per session. By combining psychological principles with beautiful, calming design, Focal transforms chaotic workdays into purposeful, accomplished ones.

---

## Problem Statement
Knowledge workers face constant context-switching, endless to-do lists, and the anxiety of choosing what to work on next. This leads to:
- Decision fatigue and procrastination
- Shallow work across many tasks instead of deep work on important ones
- End-of-day dissatisfaction despite being "busy"
- Lost ideas and thoughts due to poor capture systems
- Lack of connection between daily tasks and larger goals

---

## Solution
Focal provides:
1. **One Focus Per Session**: A hard constraint that forces prioritization
2. **Later List**: A persistent capture system for "shiny objects" that preserves focus
3. **North Star Goals**: Visual connection between daily work and meaningful objectives
4. **Calm Design**: Anxiety-reducing interface with mindful interactions
5. **Progress Tracking**: Non-shameful streaks and completion patterns

---

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Solo Professionals**: Freelancers, consultants, indie hackers
- **Knowledge Workers**: Developers, designers, writers, researchers

### User Characteristics
- Struggle with prioritization and focus
