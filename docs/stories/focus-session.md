## Main dashboard focus session usage

#### As a user:

* I want to be able to create a block of focus defining the title, description, maybe a timer and be able to start this block, pause, stop, complete, edit and delete it.
* I want to be able to insert subtasks in this block, and do similar opererations in it (like the main block).
* I want to see a subtle, bar style timer (not a circle/clock) for both my main block and the current task being executed (with they have a timer defined)
* I want to be able to add notes for "shiny objects" that come to my mind and are not related to the main topic of focus so I can check them later.
