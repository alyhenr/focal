As a user, I want to be able to track things on my radar, books I've started, on-going subjects and projects, to get a better view of the extended and broadness of things on my "RAM". 
Maybe define some configuration of what I can handle with good quality, give points to all of those things, and see with I might be trying too many stuff at the same time,  if I can connect subjects, overall, re-organize my mind.

A main topic on my radar could allow me to input keywords/topics, so I can "load" the mental model of this point.
